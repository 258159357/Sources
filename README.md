# Sources
Raw, straight decompiled source code for Terraria's Windows server.

This is a view-only repository for each verison. The primary goal is to make it easier for plugin developers and TShock developers to easily see a canonical copy of the source for each verison of Terraria.

These are not compile friendly (and likely never will be).
